								A. SubString Quest

Problem Description

Raju and Rani like playing with strings, exploring the interesting patterns of smaller parts within them, called substrings.

Presently, they are engrossed in a string-centric game and it is Raju's turn. His task involves two strings provided by Rani, namely S1 and S2. 
Raju is tasked with dividing the first string S1 into the fewest possible substrings, ensuring that all resulting substrings, whether in their original or reversed order, 
are present in S2 while also aiming for maximizing the length of current substring.

For example, if S1 = "vanaja" and S2 = "rvanpnaja", then the output will be van|aja rather than va|naja.

Note : The letter in the ith position in S1 can be used in exactly one substring of S1. The letters from S2 can be reused any number of times but the letters from S1 can be used only once. 
The letters are case sensitive in both the strings.
